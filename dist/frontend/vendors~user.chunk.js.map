Mexico,\r\n\t\t// it’s necessary to dial an additional “1” after Mexico’s country code\r\n\t\t// (which is “52”) and before the area code.\r\n\t\t// You also ignore the 045, and simply dial the area code and the\r\n\t\t// cell phone’s number.\r\n\t\t//\r\n\t\t// If you don’t add the “1”, you’ll receive a recorded announcement\r\n\t\t// asking you to redial using it.\r\n\t\t//\r\n\t\t// For example, if you are calling from the USA to a cell phone\r\n\t\t// in Mexico City, you would dial +52 – 1 – 55 – 1234 5678.\r\n\t\t// (Note that this is different to calling a land line in Mexico City\r\n\t\t// from abroad, where the number dialed would be +52 – 55 – 1234 5678)\".\r\n\t\t//\r\n\t\t// Google's demo output:\r\n\t\t//
